EVTDESC1999998003;In 1835, under the aegis of the Royal Geographical Society, the German-born explorer and naturalist Robert Hermann Schomburgk conducted botanical and geographical exploration of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Guiana. This resulted in a sketch of the territory with a line marking what he believed to be the western boundary claimed by the Dutch. As a result of this, he was commissioned in $YEAR$ by the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to survey Guiana's boundaries. This survey resulted in what came to be known as the "Schomburgk Line". The Line goes well beyond the area of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ occupation, and technically gives us control of the mouth of the Orinoco River, as well as other territories not currently under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

VNZ_found_el_callao_desc;The gold rush in Guasipati has attracted many $COUNTRY_ADJ$ and foreign settlers to the province, which has nearly managed to collapse the old, run-down colonial town. We must employ this opportunity to settle the empty lands around the Imataca by founding a new mining town with an easier access to the gold fields. Foreign surveyors suggest the area near El Callao, one of the most productive gold deposits in the province, would be a good starting point for a new town ;;;;;;;;;;;;x

lawa_railway_desc;The recent gold rush deep in the jungles of the Colony of Suriname has left us in dire need of a safe and more efficient way of transporting the precious metals to the harbor in Paramaribo. Several different surveyors have all proposed a railway extending from the coast down south to the town of Apetina, from which the gold could be transported by locomotive, it would be wise to heed their advice ;;;;;;;;;;;x
